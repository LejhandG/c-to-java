# C to Java Program Conversions

Welcome to the C to Java Program Conversions repository! In this project, I've taken programs that I originally practiced in C and converted them to Java. This repository serves as a learning resource for anyone interested in comparing C and Java implementations.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide side-by-side comparisons of C and Java implementations for various programming problems. By converting C programs to Java, we can explore the similarities and differences between these two languages, fostering a better understanding of their syntax and features.

## How to Use

To learn about how to code and run Java programs, refer to the [Learn Java repository](https://github.com/LejhandG/learn-java). This repository provides comprehensive guidance and tutorials on Java programming.
